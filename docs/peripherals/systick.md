# SysTick Timer

SysTick is a small timer built into the ARM Cortex-M3 core. It is not an STM32
timer peripheral like `TIM2` or `TIM3`; it lives in the Cortex-M private
peripheral area and is available on every STM32F103 core.

SysTick is commonly used for a fixed time base, such as a 1 ms system tick,
simple delays, or a small cooperative scheduler.

## Basic Idea

SysTick is a 24-bit down-counter:

| Step | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Load | Software writes the reload value into `STK_LOAD`. |
| Count | The counter decrements from that value down to zero. |
| Wrap | When it reaches zero, it reloads and sets the count flag. |
| Interrupt | If enabled, the wrap event calls `SysTick_Handler`. |

The reload value controls the period:

```text
reload = tick_clock_hz / ticks_per_second - 1
```

For example, if the core clock is `8 MHz` and you want a 1 ms tick, use:

```text
reload = 8_000_000 / 1000 - 1 = 7999
```

## Registers You Use Most

SysTick is controlled by core memory-mapped registers. It does not need an RCC
peripheral clock enable.

| Register | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `STK_CTRL` | Enables SysTick, selects the clock source, enables the interrupt, and exposes the count flag. |
| `STK_LOAD` | Holds the 24-bit reload value. The maximum value is `0x00FF_FFFF`. |
| `STK_VAL` | Holds the current counter value. Writing any value clears the counter and count flag. |
| `STK_CALIB` | STM32-provided calibration value for a 1 ms reference when using the external SysTick clock. |

The most common setup for a 1 ms interrupt tick is:

```c
#define SYSTICK_BASE  (0xE000E010UL)
#define STK_CTRL      (*(volatile unsigned int *)(SYSTICK_BASE + 0x00UL))
#define STK_LOAD      (*(volatile unsigned int *)(SYSTICK_BASE + 0x04UL))
#define STK_VAL       (*(volatile unsigned int *)(SYSTICK_BASE + 0x08UL))

#define STK_CTRL_ENABLE     (1u << 0)
#define STK_CTRL_TICKINT    (1u << 1)
#define STK_CTRL_CLKSOURCE  (1u << 2)

volatile unsigned int ticks_ms;

void systick_init_1ms(unsigned int core_clock_hz)
{
    STK_LOAD = (core_clock_hz / 1000u) - 1u;
    STK_VAL = 0u;
    STK_CTRL = STK_CTRL_CLKSOURCE | STK_CTRL_TICKINT | STK_CTRL_ENABLE;
}

void SysTick_Handler(void)
{
    ticks_ms++;
}
```

With `STK_CTRL_CLKSOURCE` set, SysTick uses the Cortex clock, usually `HCLK`.
With it cleared, STM32F1 feeds SysTick from `HCLK / 8`.

## Practical Notes

SysTick is simple, but it has limits:

| Topic | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Counter width | The reload value is only 24 bits, so long delays need software counters. |
| Clock changes | If you change `HCLK`, recompute `STK_LOAD` or the tick period changes. |
| Interrupt handler | The vector table must contain `SysTick_Handler` at the SysTick exception slot. |
| Busy waits | Polling the count flag works, but wastes CPU while waiting. |
| Low power | SysTick is core-related; check the sleep mode behavior before using it as a wake source. |

SysTick is a good first timer because it avoids GPIO pins, alternate functions,
prescalers, and APB timer clock details. Use the general-purpose timers later
when you need PWM, input capture, output compare, encoder mode, or independent
timer channels.

## Reference Manual Pages

Use the project-local STM32F103 reference manual for the STM32-specific SysTick
details:

| SysTick vector-table entry | [RM0008 page 204](../refs/stm32f103x8-reference.pdf#page=204) |

RM0008 describes the STM32 clock connection, calibration value, and exception
vector. The full bit-level definition of `STK_CTRL`, `STK_LOAD`, `STK_VAL`, and
`STK_CALIB` belongs to the Cortex-M3 core documentation.
